/**
 * settings.js — the single source of truth for every tweakable value in the sandbox.
 *
 * Nothing in the renderer owns state that lives here: shaders, particle systems,
 * lights and post processing all *read* these objects every frame. That is what
 * makes the real-time editor work without rebuilding anything — mutating a field
 * is immediately visible on screen, including on an ice field that is already
 * standing, and including while the clock is paused (`P`), which is when the
 * shapes are actually worth tuning.
 *
 * The one rule that keeps that promise: a system may only ever *sample* these
 * values. It must never copy one into a record at spawn time and read it back
 * later — see `IceAbility`, whose spike records hold nothing but unitless dice
 * rolls, and resolve every metre, radian and second against this file each frame.
 *
 * Conventions
 *  - Colours are stored as `#rrggbb` strings so lil-gui can bind them directly.
 *    Use `utils/color.js#getColor()` to read them as a cached THREE.Color.
 *  - `global` holds multipliers that scale everything at once (1 = neutral).
 *  - The per-ability blocks (`ice`, `thunder`, `meteor`, `beam`) hold absolute values.
 *
 * Every ability block is keyed by its id in `ELEMENTS`, and the shared systems
 * that need to know about "the ability the player is currently holding" — the
 * aim controller, the cooldown, the HUD — look it up as `settings[element]`.
 * The four fields they rely on being present are `range`, `minRange`, `speed`
 * and `cooldown`; everything else in a block is that ability's own business.
 * A **far cast** (`CastShape.ZONE`, declared in `ELEMENT_META`) adds a fifth:
 * `zoneRadius`, the footprint the circle indicator measures out.
 */

/**
 * The cast animations shipped alongside the rig, in `public/models/<id>.fbx`.
 *
 * Every ability block carries a `castAnim` naming one of these, so each spell
 * can throw the body differently; `CharacterController` loads all of them once
 * at boot and keeps only their clips, and the editor turns this array straight
 * into the per-ability dropdown.

   *
   * The rock is real geometry — a cratered, faceted asteroid generated by
   * `assets/ProceduralGeometry.js` — shaded by a patched standard material so it
   * casts and receives the stage's shadows. Its signature is the **lava seams**:
   * the zero crossing of an fbm field sampled in the rock's own local space, so
   * the cracks are welded to it and tumble with it. `chargeCurve` decides how
   * fast they prise open on the way in.
   *
   * Behind it hangs the **fire trail**: a black-body volume raymarched inside a
   * camera-facing proxy hull laid along the arc. See the `trail*` block.
   *
   * As in `ice` and `thunder`, a cast captures nothing but dice and timestamps:
   * one seed, one tumble axis and a few unitless rolls per debris chunk. The
   * trajectory, the size of the rock, the width of its seams and the whole
   * ballistic flight of every chunk are resolved against this block each frame —
   * which is why dragging `arc` re-lofts a meteor already in the air, and

  /**
   * A sustained super beam: the caster winds up a ball of light in both hands,
   * then lets a column of it out along the aimed line, where it *stays* —
   * burning into the floor for `lifetime` before it collapses back to a thread
   * and blinks out. Reference for the look: `superbeam.jpg`.
   *
   * This is the ability with a **fourth beat**. Ice, thunder and meteor all run
   * travel → impact → fade; the beam puts a `charge` in front of that, so the
   * shot is something you watch arrive *and* something that lands and holds.
   * Nothing in the base class needed changing for it — `BeamAbility` simply
   * refuses to let the front leave the hand until the orb is up to power.
   *
   * The column is **one tube** — see `assets/ProceduralGeometry.js` — drawn
   * three times at three radii by `materials/BeamMaterial.js`: a wide halo, a
   * hollow rim-weighted sheath and, inside it, a core weighted the *opposite*
   * way, brightest where the view ray runs down the barrel. That inversion is
   * what makes the middle read as a solid rod of light instead of as a lit
   * pipe. The coils spiralling around it and the shock discs racing down it are
   * two more instanced passes placed against the same radius profile, so all
   * five stay welded together when the shape is dragged.
   *
   * Deliberately *not* electric: no kinks anywhere. The bolt's noise is
   * piecewise-linear so it keeps its corners; every noise term here is smooth
   * and stretched hard along the flow, because a beam that kinks is a bolt.
   *
   * As in every other block, a cast captures nothing but one seed and a few
   * timestamps. The barrel, the flare, the coil pitch and the disc train are all
   * resolved against these numbers each frame — which is why dragging `radius`
   * re-bores a beam that is already burning, with the clock stopped.

  /**
   * A trap planted at a point rather than a shot fired along a line: the caster
   * whips a leash of current out across the floor, and where it lands the ring
   * snaps open — a column of lightning tears up out of the middle, tendrils
   * crawl outward to the boundary and arcs run around the rim, all of it
   * holding, re-striking and dragging the air upward for `lifetime` before it
   * collapses. Reference for the look: `electricalboost.jpg`.
   *
   * This is the block that defines what a far cast *is* in this project. The
   * targeting is a circle (see the `zone` block) and `zoneRadius` is the promise
   * that circle makes: the boundary the indicator draws is the boundary the
   * field burns, the tendrils reach and the rim arcs run along, so dragging that
   * one number re-scales the indicator and a snare that is already standing
   * together.
   *
   * The whole cage is **one instanced strip** — see `materials/SnareMaterial.js`.
   * Every filament is the same ribbon, and a *role* decided from its instance
   * index (leash → column → tendril → rim) picks which parametric path the
   * vertex shader threads it along. Two draw calls for all four, however many
   * filaments are in the air.
   *
   * As in every other block, a cast captures nothing but a seed and a few
   * timestamps. Every metre, radian and second is resolved against these numbers
   * each frame — including a zero-length one, which is why the trap reshapes
   * under the sliders with the clock stopped.

  /**
   * A cold front races along the floor to the aimed point, the disc freezes out
   * to the boundary the circle drew, and a wall of crystal tears up out of the
   * ground around it: a ring of blades leaning outward with a skirt of wreckage
   * banked against their feet. It stands, glints, breathes cold off its rim —
   * and then breaks into plates and sinks back into the floor. Reference for the
   * look: `Hud7Xfg3LH.jpg`.
   *
   * The **middle stays open**: every shard is seated in a band about
   * `zoneRadius` and nothing is planted in the centre, because the read is a
   * wall you are looking into and filling the disc stops it being a ring. What
   * lives inside it is air and frozen ground.
   *
   * The second **far cast**, and the counterpart to the Voltaic Snare: same
   * circle, same promise, opposite answer. The snare fills the footprint with
   * current standing in the air; this one fills it with geometry standing on the
   * ground, so `zoneRadius` is again the one number that matters — it is where
   * the ring of blades is seated, where the sheet's boundary band burns, where
   * the curtain of cold air stands and where the rime creeps.
   *
   * Three things carry it, and each has its own group below:
   *
   *  - **the sweep.** The ring does not appear; it *closes*. The blade nearest
   *    the caster goes up first and the wave runs around both sides to meet
   *    behind the crown (`sweepTime`), with the skirt banking up behind the wave
   *    (`skirtDelay`, `skirtWave`).
   *  - **the freeze front.** Every shard crystallises upward along its own axis
   *    while it rises (`frontRough`, `frontWidth`, `frontGlow` — see
   *    `materials/GlacierMaterial.js`), so the ice *forms* rather than sliding
   *    out of a hole.
   *  - **the shatter.** It leaves the same way it arrived, in pieces: a
